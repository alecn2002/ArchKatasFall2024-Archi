The Team will use Architectural Decision Records
[(ADRs](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-software/9781098134341/ch03.html#architectural_decision_records_left_pare)

##Status
proposed

##Context
 - The Team needs to remember the fundamental architectural choices it makes.

##Decision
Use ADRs in the architectural description for the Project.

###PROS:

 - Some effort needed for managing and discussing ADRs among Team members.
